We then added additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. We used FourSquare API that provide additional information about each of these locations. Knockout was used to handle the list, filter, and any other information on the page that is subject to changing state.
